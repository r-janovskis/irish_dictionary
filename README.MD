# Irish Dictionary Project

## Problem I try to solve

As I have been trying to learn a bit of an Irish I have come to an issue of how to keep track of words I have learned and how to look them up.
So far I have been using notepad, but this approach has several drawbacks:

- I tried to organize words in several categories, like foods, places, place names, professions, etc, but there is only so much space on a page...
- There are quiet few words that would sit well under several categories and there are also some that complement other words, like adjectives - where do you put them?
- As the amount of words accumulate it's hard to look up older ones when they come up in some exercises to check spelling or just refresh what it was.

Those are just few of the challenges where this app would come in handy.

- It could organize words with categories nicely and allow word to be tied to several categories without writing it down over and over again
- Look up of words I learned a while ago would be easier with nicely created search function
- Getting more context how word is used in different situations with help from the internet

## Potential solution

In this project I will try to create a simple web app that could help:

- It could organize words with categories nicely and allow word to be tied to several categories without writing it down over and over again
- Look up of words I learned a while ago would be easier with nicely created search function
- Getting more context how word is used in different situations with help from the internet
- As we keep on developing we can try to create a little word matching game

## Tools

I would try to create a web app that would use:

- **Python (Flask)** to create a logic and back-end for the environment
- **PostgreSQL** as a database where to save irish words with their English translations, pronaunciations and other bits
- **JavaScript and React** will be used to create a user-friendly front-end to the application
